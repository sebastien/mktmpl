# *mktmpl* ― Makefile-based templates

*mktmpl* is a self-contained `Makefile` that generates project files
given a template. Compared to simliar tools, *mktmpl* does not require
to install any package or tool besides what you'd find in a regular Unix
development environment.

`mktmpl` main features are:

- Zero-requirement (besides a standard Unix development environment)
- Language agnostic
- Self-contained

Users of a template typically simply have to `git clone` the repository and
type `make`, at which point they are invited to configure the template
before it self-destructs and gets replaced by the expanded template.

## Quickstart

### Creating and publishing a template

Clone the `mktmpl` repository

```
$ git clone git@github.com:sebastien/mktmpl.git YOUR_NEW_TEMPLATE
$ cd YOUR_NEW_TEMPLATE
```  

You can now populate your template files and directories in `tmpl`. You can use
template variables like `{VARIABLE}` in your file and directory names, or in the
content of `.tmpl` files.

These *template variables* will be automatically detected and expanded to the
value set in the `Makefile.conf` by the user. Files ending in `.tmpl` will
have their suffix dropped.

``` 
$ mkdir tmpl
$ echo "# {PROJECT} Readme" > tmpl/README.tmpl
$ mkdir 'tmpl/src/{LANG}/{PROJECT}'
$ echo "# This is the main file for {PROJECT}" > 'tmpl/src/{LANG}/{PROJECT}/main.{LANG}'
$ vi README.md
```

If you'd like to see the content of your template, run `make manifest`.
At any point you can test your template by running `make apply`. This will
ask you to edit a configuration file using `$EDITOR` (or `vi`) and will
populate `.dist` with the applied `tmpl` files and directories.

Once you're done, you simply need to add the `tmpl` files to the repository
and publish it. That's it!

### Using a template

If you'd like to create a new project from a *mktmpl* template, you
would simply need to do the following:

```
$ git clone YOUR_TEMPLATE_REPOSITORY YOUR_NEW_PROJECT
$ cd YOUR_NEW_PROJECT
$ make
```

The first run of `make` will pop-up your `$EDITOR` and ask you to fill in the
main variables for the project.

If successful, the original template files will be moved to the `.tmpl`
directory within your project. If you'd like to re-generate the project, run
`pushd .tmpl ; make revert ; popd` and then either `make config` to change
configuration options or `make` to rebuild everything using the same configuration.

## Makefile rules 

The following rules are available up until the moment you `make cleanup`:

- `make all` ― The default rule that does `make apply` followed by `make cleanup`

- `make manifest|mf` ― Lists the files that are part of the project template. 

- `make variables|vars` ― Lists the variables defined 

- `make configure|config` ― Creates the `Makefile.conf` (or `$TEMPLATE_CONF`) file and runs
  `$EDITOR` on it. Once the editor quits, the makefile will try to 
   apply the configuration to the templates.

- `make apply` ­― Applies the configuration to produce the templates in the
  `$PRODUCT_PATH?=.dist` directory. All the files in
  `tmpl` will be expanded using the configuration and written
  to `.dist`.

- `make cleanup` ― Cleans up the *mktmpl* files and moves all the `.dist`
  files within the current directory. The *mktmpl* files
  are then backed up to `.tmpl`. You can revert everything
  by `cd .tmpl ; make revert`.

- `make revert` ―  Reverts a `make cleanup`, returning to the result
   of `make apply` in the parent directory.

- `make rules` ― Lists the generated makefile rules  that produce the applied
   template files. This is mostly useful for debugging.

## Makefile variables

These are variables that you can override if you need to change some of the
paths or extensions used by the main *mktmpl* makefile.

- `TEMPLATE_OUTPUT`: The path where the template should be output. By default, this is
  the folder in which the template makefile is located.

- `TEMPLATE_CONF`: The name of the makefile template configuration file where the 
  template variable's values is going to be stored.

- `TEMPLATE_PATH`: The path where the template sources/files are located. By default,
  it is `tmpl`

- `TEMPLATE_BACKUP`: The path where the original template directory will be moved once the
   template is applied (`.tmpl` by default).

## How does it work?

Template variables are defined as a `VARNAME:=VALUE` mapping in `Makefile.conf`, which
is dynamically loaded when the *mktmpl* Makefile is run.

Any file ending in `.tmpl` will have matching `{VARNAME}` strings
in its contents replaced with the coreresponding value in `Makefile.conf`.
Any file or directory which path contains `{VARNAME}` will also be expanded using the same rule.

Here's what happens when running `make` or `make all`:

1) *configuration phase*: `make` generates `Makefile.conf` based on all variables ecountered, $EDITOR` opens `Makefile.conf`
2) *apply phase*:  if all variables are set, the templates are expanded in `.dist`
3) *cleanup phase*: the *mktmpl* files are moved to `.tmpl` and the contents of `.dist` is moved 
   in the current directory.

## Similar Projects

There are a few similar projects:

- [CookieCutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) is a Python tool that
  has similar goals and more features, but act as a standalone tool as opposed to a self-contained script.
  It is, in my opinion, the best of the software listed here, thanks to its simple configuration
  and CLI.

- [Kickstart](https://github.com/Keats/kickstart), described [here](https://dev.to/artemix/kickstart-a-fast-and-simple-project-bootstrapper-40k1) 
  supports conditional templates and interactive configuration options, as well as relatively advanced way
  to configure the interactive prompt that collects template configuration information.

- [Tinpig](https://github.com/bit101/tinpig), has a centralized template respository and an interactive CLI.
  It dependes on `node` to run.

- [Template](https://github.com/fabiospampinato/template) is similar to `tinpig` (with an arguably better name)
  and also depends on `node`.

You may prefer `mktmpl` to the above if you:

- Don't want to install another tool (`mktmpl` is *self-contained*)
- Trust that users can `$EDIT` the configuration variables themselves
- Only need to support UNIXes
